Sublime Salesforce Reference 1.4.0 Release Notes:

Re-engineering:
  - Modify Table of Contents retrieval to use page scraping
    - Salesforce has done away with the publically accessible XML Table of 
      Contents files we previously utilised to work out what articles to 
      present and where to link to.
      
      As such, we now have to scrape the Table of Contents out of the public 
      facing doc site. For a more technical explanation see commit notes here: 
      https://github.com/Oblongmana/sublime-salesforce-reference/commit/c4cb7c008e50c4ec4e3fb86b341b13ce1e07baea

    - The primary impact here will be that getting the table of contents runs 
      a little slower: due to the overhead of retrieving a whole web page 
      intended for human users. You hopefully shouldn't notice a difference, 
      but if you run into any problems, please log an issue at https://github.
      com/Oblongmana/sublime-salesforce-reference/issues, and/or tweet at me
