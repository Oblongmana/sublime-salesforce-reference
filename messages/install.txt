# Sublime Salesforce Reference

A plugin for Sublime Text that gives you quick access to Salesforce Documentation from Sublime Text.

## Installation

1. **Recommended:** Download [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and install using the *Package Control: Install Package* command (search for *Salesforce Reference*)
2. **Not recommended:** Clone the repo or download a release at https://github.com/Oblongmana/sublime-salesforce-reference, and save it to a *SublimeSalesforceReference* directory inside your Sublime Packages/ directory. You will not receive automatic updates as you would following option 1

## Usage 

SublimeSalesforceReference adds multiple new commands to your palette:
  - `Salesforce Reference - Apex`
  - `Salesforce Reference - Visualforce`
  - `Salesforce Reference - Service Console`
  - `Salesforce Reference - All Documentation Types` 

Simply select one of these commands, and the plugin will retrieve an index of reference pages from Salesforce and show them to you in a quick panel. Search for what you're after, press enter, and the documentation page will open in your web browser!


## Settings

See `Preference > Package Settings > Salesforce Reference` for available/default settings.

By default, when Sublime Text starts up, the plugin will make a callout to cache the Salesforce Reference Index for the `Apex` and `Visualforce` documentation, so that when you run a `Salesforce Reference` command, the list of reference pages will open instantly without making an http callout. You can customise this behaviour per documentation type using `refreshCacheOnLoad`

You can exclude specific documentation types from the `All Documentation Types` command by changing the `excludeFromAllDocumentationCommand` setting per documentation type.
