# Sublime Salesforce Reference

A plugin for Sublime Text that gives you quick access to Salesforce Documentation from Sublime Text.

## Installation

1. **Recommended:** Download [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and install using the *Package Control: Install Package* command (search for *Salesforce Reference*)
2. **Not recommended:** Simply download this repo and save it to a *SublimeSalesforceReference* directory inside your Sublime Packages/ directory. You will not receive automatic updates as you would following option 1

## Usage 

SublimeSalesforceReference adds a new command to your palette: *'Salesforce Reference'*. Simply select this command, and wait for a few moments for the plugin to retrieve an index of reference pages from Salesforce. At this point, a quick panel will pop up list documentation options; search for what you're after, press enter, and the documentation page will open in your web browser
