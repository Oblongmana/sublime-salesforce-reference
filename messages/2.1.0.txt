Sublime Salesforce Reference 2.1.0 Release Notes:

Re-engineering:
  - Modify Table of Contents retrieval to new JSON Table of Contents
    - Possible impact will be a _slightly_ faster retrieval speed, as we're
      retrieving a dedicated ToC instead of a full HTML page
    - Salesforce's doc portal has moved to an angular app, which in short -
      means the previous scraping approach has broken.
      Some further digging in the angular app's source turned up the new JSON
      ToC, hence our re-engineering to use these instead of scraping.
