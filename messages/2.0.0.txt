Sublime Salesforce Reference 2.0.0 Release Notes:

This release adds new types of documentation - so not only do you have access
to Apex doc, you can now access Visualforce and Service Console docs! This
release also adds a command to show all types of documentation at once, and
provides new settings for configuring which documentation types get
automatically cache, and allows you to exclude specific documentation types from
the new "All Documentation" command.

This is marked as a major release, due to a change that could potentially break
custom key bindings for existing users. This won't affect most users, but see
the end of these release notes for details if this affects you.

Enhancements:
  - Add new documentation types (thanks to Marco Zeuli
     [https://github.com/maaaaarco] for his significant contribution to this
     feature). Each documentation type is available as a list under new
     commands - functioning just like the old command:
    + "Salesforce Reference - Apex"
    + "Salesforce Reference - Visualforce"
    + "Salesforce Reference - Service Console"
    + "Salesforce Reference - All Documentation Types": this special command
        shows a list containing all documentation links for all documentation
        types, mashed into a single list.

  - Each of the new documentation types has corresponding settings in your
     settings file (`Preferences > Package Settings > Salesforce Reference >
     Settings - User` - copy from `Settings - Default` if these are missing).
     For each documentation type, you can control:
    + `refreshCacheOnLoad`: the top level `refreshCacheOnLoad` setting still
        controls whether to retrieve and cache documentation at all during
        Sublime startup, but during that process, the plugin will check each
        `docType`s setting to see whether a specific Documentation type gets
        cached during startup or not (the default is to cache Apex and
        Visualforce during startup, but not Service Console).
    + `excludeFromAllDocumentationCommand`: if you set this to true for a
        particular `docType` - the "Salesforce Reference - All Documentation
        Types" command will exclude this doc type from its list.

  - Threading has been improved to support this new system - doc retrieval jobs
     can run at the same time, important for retrieving multiple docs at once.
     This is not likely to have significant impact on you - the end user - but
     it's nice to have, trust us :D

Breaking Changes:
  - The old "Salesforce Reference" command (`salesforce_reference`) no longer
     exists. The equivalent new command is "Salesforce Reference - Apex"
     (`salesforce_reference_apex`) - as the old command only retrieved Apex
     documentation.
    + This change should only be important for users who have set up a key
        binding for the command - if that's you, simply replace
        `salesforce_reference` with `salesforce_reference_apex` in your key
        bindings
