Sublime Salesforce Reference 2.0.0 Release Notes:

This release adds new types of documentation - so not only do you have access
to Apex doc, you can now access Visualforce and Service Console docs!

This is marked as a major release, due to some changes that could potentially
break some configuration for existing users. This will be very minor - only a
renamed command. See the end of these release notes for details.


Enhancements:
  - Add new documentation types (thanks to Marco Zeuli
     [https://github.com/maaaaarco]) for his significant contribution to this
     feature. Each documentation type is available individually under new
     commands, and will present a list of links that open in browser, just
     like the old command:
    + "Salesforce Reference - Apex"
    + "Salesforce Reference - Visualforce"
    + "Salesforce Reference - Service Console"
    + "Salesforce Reference - All Documentation Types": this special command
        shows a list containing all of the documentation links for all of the
        different documentation types, mashed into one single list.

  - Each of the new documentation types has corresponding settings in your
     settings file (`Preferences > Package Settings > Salesforce Reference >
     Settings - User` - copy from `Settings - Default` if these are missing).
     For each documentation type, you can control:
    + `refreshCacheOnLoad`: the top level `refreshCacheOnLoad` setting still
        controls whether to retrieve and cache documentation at all during
        Sublime startup, but during that process, the plugin will check each
        `docType`s setting to see whether a specific Documentation type gets
        cached during startup or not (the default is to cache Apex and
        Visualforce during startup, but not Service Console).
    + `excludeFromAllDocumentationCommand`: if you set this to true for a
        particular `docType` - the "Salesforce Reference - All Documentation
        Types" command will exclude this doc type from its list.

  - Threading has been improved to support this new system - doc retrieval jobs
     can run at the same time, important for retrieving multiple docs at once.
     This is not likely to have significant impact on you - the end user - but
     it's nice to have, trust us :D

Breaking Changes:
  - The old "Salesforce Reference" command (`salesforce_reference`) no longer
     exists. The equivalent new command is "Salesforce Reference - Apex"
     (`salesforce_reference_apex`) - as the old command only retrieved Apex
     documentation.
    + This change should only be important for users who have set up a key
        binding for the command - if that's you, simply replace
        `salesforce_reference` with `salesforce_reference_apex` in your key
        bindings
